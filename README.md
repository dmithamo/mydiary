# MyDiary

This repo tracks the building out of the UI templates and API backend for an online journal where users can chronicle their thoughts, feelings and dark secrets.

## UI Features

The UI provides intuitive pages, with elements for user registration and login.
On login, a user can navigate to an entries page, profile page, and a settings page.
