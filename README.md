# MyDiary
Repo for an online journal where users can chronicle their thoughts, feelings and dark secrets.

### An Intro
`MyDiary` is an app designed to supplant your typical pen and paper journal.
It is an online platform where you can pen your unforgetable experiences, detail your
thoughts, assess your feelings, etc. etc.

### Features
`MyDiary` provides the following features :
* An intuitive, easy to use UI - the app is designed to be used exactly as your pen and paper
journal is (substituting the pen and paper for a keyboard and screen). You simply create an account,
login, and start pouring out your thoughts. Quite like buying a journal, flipping it to an empty page,
and writing!

* Lifetime storage, right to be forgoten - we will store your memories until you decide to delete them. 
And when you ask us to, we will completely remove them from all our records, disappearing them forever.

* Security - only you can view the plain text version of your entries. Your entries are stored
as encrypted records, in a format that is entirely incomprehensible to any other party besides
you. Decryption to readable form strictly requires your login credentials. 
(Please keep your password as securely as possible).

* We are constantly adding new features. Stay tuned to be in the know.
