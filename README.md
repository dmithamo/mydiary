# MyDiary

This repo tracks the building out of the UI templates and API backend for an online journal where users can chronicle their thoughts, feelings and dark secrets.

## UI Features

The UI provides intuitive pages, with elements for user registration and login.
On login, a user can navigate to an entries page, profile page, and a settings page.
Preview available at [dmithamo/mydiary](https://dmithamo.github.io/mydiary/index.html).
Code for the UI tracked in [this branch](https://github.com/dmithamo/mydiary/tree/gh-pages) of the repo.

**PS** : Work in Progress. Some UI elements may be unfunctional.
